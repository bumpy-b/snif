README for Sensor Network Inspection Framework

REQUIREMENTS

1. A JSR-82 implementation if live data should be received from the distributed sniffer
Note that the Bluetooth Stack of Windows XP does not support L2CAP, so there is no
JSR-82 implementation which can provide L2CAP connections on top of that.
The JSR-82 BT stack from avetana works on top of a widcomm stack.
The avetana bt stack is fine for linux (even free) and mac os x.

2. The complete BTnode Development Envrionment
You need the CVS HEAD version of BTnut, BTnut Release 1.8 is not sufficient.
It is available at http://www.btnode.ethz.ch


COMPILE
run "ant libs" to download the required libraries
run "ant javacc" to create the packet defininition parser

run "ant" to finally compile all source files

for some strange reasons, the java compiler does not recognize the
source="1.5" option and ant fails.

you can use Eclipse to compile the sources instead


TEST
A quick test could be the following:
- install the sniffer application from sniffer/ on BTnode A
- install the simpel data gathering application from test/routing_a on BTnode B
- run the DSNPacketDumper class
If everything is ok, the application will connect to the first BTnode it finds,
send the sniffer configuration and will start forwarding overheared ChipCon CC1000
traffic to the host.
