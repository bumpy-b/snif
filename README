README for Sensor Network Inspection Framework

COMPILE
run "ant libs" to download the required libraries
run "ant javacc" to create the packet defininition parser

run "ant" to finally compile all source files

for some strange reasons, the java compiler does not recognize the
source="1.5" option and ant fails.

you can use Eclipse to compile the sources instead
